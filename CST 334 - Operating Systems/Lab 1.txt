#What linux system are you using?
# I am using centOS ea ≥≥≥≥≥≥≥≥≥≥≥≥≥≥≥q1	m/q`on Mac. 
# Did you experience any difficulties with this lab task? 
# Since I am new with working in Linux and bash shell, I was a little
# confused at first with how they worked. However, once I completed
# all of the readings and watched all of the lecture videos, I was able
# to complete the task with minimal difficulties. The only difficulty I had was
# trying to adjust to the syntax of working in vi.
