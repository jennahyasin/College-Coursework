  <p>The sixth furthest planet away from the Sun is Saturn. Saturn is part of the gas giants, and is the second-largest planet in the entire solar system. Its size comes from its very large volume, rather than its density. In terms of density, it weighs â…› of the average weight of Earth. Saturn has rings surrounding itself, but they are very thin.
